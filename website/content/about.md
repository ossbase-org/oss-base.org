# ossbase.org - Empowering Open Source Security Software Through Support, Autonomy, and Collaboration.

ossbase.org is an organization dedicated to supporting secure and open-source security software, fostering their growth and development.

## Objectives

- Establish a legal and secure framework for open source security projects.
- Uphold the autonomy of open source security projects, with ossbase.org serving as a supportive ally.
- Offer a streamlined, user-friendly structure for the development and management of open source security initiatives.
- Facilitate testing and ensure interoperability among various open source security projects.
- Provide a sanctuary for orphaned or unmaintained open source projects or open data, ensuring continued software maintenance.
- Implement an emergency fund and contracting process to address critical vulnerabilities in unmaintained open source projects.

## Core Rules

- Respect the existing rules and practices of supported open source projects; avoid imposing changes that could harm existing processes or the community.
- Promote diversity in the ownership of open source projects. Ensure that the open source license is permanently fixed and cannot be altered.
- Provide support to the communities and users of open source projects, aligning with the broader interests of the global community.
